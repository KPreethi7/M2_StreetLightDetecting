Now-a-days  the  amount  of  power  consumed  by lighting and streets shares a major energy demand. The vehicles are passing over always and a part of places will be consisting of less density areas and even no vehicle moments itself in few areas. But during night all street lights will be on in conventional street lighting system.  To  overcome from  this issue, a proper energy saving  methods  and  lighting  control  to  be  implemented.  The proposed work  is to have two  controls like, one is  to switch of lights  during  no  vehicle  moments  in  streets  and automatically switch it on when vehicles arrive and the other modes are to give less intensity light for pedestrian and to switch on bright mode during vehicle moments at sides on the roads. In this  work the LED lights are used for street arrangement, the Photo diodes and IR sensors are used to sense vehicle moments.
